Educational, creative and fun projects that I found on the web.

### Project Setup

For documentation purposes to generate the base project and dev environment we are using

```
npx express-generator --hbs edu-js-creative
npx prettier --write .
```

To ensure auto-reload make sure to create a `.env` file with this content:

```
NODE_ENV="development"
```
